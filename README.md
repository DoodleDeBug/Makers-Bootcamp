# Makers-Bootcamp

This repo will contain all/most of the things I did/made at Makers during my 12 week intensive software engineering bootcamp. I hope it will serve as a record of my work and be something I can look back on to see my progress.

## Navigation

Each week directory will have a README with the pair and weekend (and maybe some other) challenges outlined, as well as the folders for each of those projects. Within the project folders, there will be another README detailing the specifics of each project.
