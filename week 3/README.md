# Week 3

## Pair Challenge: Battle

Had a fun time this week doing the Battle challenge. It was nice making something you could use in a browser as opposed to only working in the terminal and it gave me lots of ideas for other webapps I could make!

## Weekend Challenge: RPS

This challenge was really fun and completing it helped me feel much more confident with Sinatra , Rspec, Capybara and the MVC pattern

## Extra: Birthday Greeter

Altough I didn't manage to finish this, it gave me a more solid background in the MVC pattern which made the weekend challenge much easier.
