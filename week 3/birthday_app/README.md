# Birthday Greeter App

I am doing this challenge as a practical during my self-study time. My challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

* wish the user happy birthday
* tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

## Proposed screens:
