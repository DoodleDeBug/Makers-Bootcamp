# Birthday Greeter App

I am doing this challenge as a practical during my self-study time. My challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

* wish the user happy birthday
* tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

## My Takeaways 

Having to start from nothing and then jumping straight into code made me realise the importance of sticking to my process and doing things in order. It also made me appreciate writing tests as I go. 

I also got to work with Date and got more confident with the MVC pattern.
