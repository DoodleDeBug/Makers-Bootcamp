# Week 1

## Pair Challenge: Boris Bikes

I got to about step 15 this week. I felt it went well for the first challenge, and, although I would have liked to complete more, I still felt that I had learnt a lot from the parts that I did do.

## Weekend Challenge: Airport

I got through about 4 user stories. Altough all my tests passed, I think I got the wrong end of the stick and should have put my land/ take_off methods on the airport class rather than on the plane. This challenge highlighted some of my weak points such as working with attribute readers, but I also learnt some things and used new tools like rubocop.
