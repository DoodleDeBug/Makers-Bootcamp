# Week 5

## Group Challenge: MakersBnB

For our first group challenge, this went really well. I was especially proud that I managed to keep up despite struggling with and missing a lot of the databases practice last week. This week I definitely got more comfortable using and setting up databases. I also took on the challenge of implementing the filtering function. Things to improve would be: 1. Make it look better by adding more css 2. Add more features from the spec

## Weekend Challenge: Bowling
