# Week 5

## Group Challenge: MakersBnB

For our first group challenge, this went really well. I was especially proud that I managed to keep up despite struggling with and missing a lot of the databases practice last week. This week I definitely got more comfortable using and setting up databases. I also took on the challenge of implementing the filtering function. Things to improve would be: 1. Make it look better by adding more css 2. Add more features from the spec

## Weekend Challenge: Bowling Ruby

I didn't get a chance to do this in week 5 so I worked on it over week 7. Initially I found the planning very difficult, but from the advice taken from my process review I broke it into smaller pieces and started with the easiest thing which was a gutter game, then the perfect game and went on from there.
