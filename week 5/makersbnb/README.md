# MakersBnB

A web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night. (AirBnB clone)

## User Stories:

### MVP:
```
As a user
I want to view a list of all spaces
So that I can see what spaces are available

As a host
I want to add a new space
So that users can see my space

As a host
I want to add additional information about my space
So that users can understand more about my space

As a user
I want to see the date that the space is available
So that I know when it's available to book
```

As a User
I want to be able to filter spaces available within a range of dates
So that I can see what spaces are available in the time I'd like to rent
