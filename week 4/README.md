# Week 4

This was a pretty challenging week because I had technical issues most of the time. Thankfully, I managed to fix those by the beginning of the next week.

The main focus of this week was utilizing databases.

## Pair Challenge: Bookmark Manager

Didn't get very far with this but utilized most of the concepts here in our week 5 group project

## Weekend Challenge: Chitter

Had another go at this during weekend 5.
