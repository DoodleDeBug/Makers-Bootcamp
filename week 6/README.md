# Week 6

## Group Challenge: JS Thermostat

Using JS for the first time at Makers. It was interesting to work with jest as I had never done any testing in JS before but I liked using it and found it easier to get used to because of the experience I now had with rspec. Working with callbacks and async JS was tricky at first but by the end of the week I understood it more and felt more able to use it, however I still need to find out how to properly test the async stuff.

## Weekend Challenge: Bowling JS

Did not get a chance to try this - might attempt later
