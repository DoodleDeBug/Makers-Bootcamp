# Week 2 

## Pair Challenge: Oystercard

I got on with this challenge better than last weeks so that hopefully shows that I have learnt something! Although, it did bring up points to work on like rspec matchers and doubles.

## Weekend Challenge: Takeaway

Having done the review and looked at other students examples, it is clear that my solution is slightly oversimplified. On one hand this made it easy to review, but there is definitely room for improvement and refactoring to be done! The reviewing process was really helpful because it highlighted things I needed to work on. I also found reviewing someone elses work useful because it made me realise the importance of commenting code and including irb examples/ guidance on how to use the code. This is something I hope to implement in all my projects going forward. Also I heard that the extension was not very complicated or time consuming so that may be something I attempt next time.
