# Oystercard

This week we were challenged to build a more complex system which stretched our skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design. We had to implement the following user stories to simulate an oystercard. I managed to complete 10 out of 12 user stories (as of 3/11/21)

## User Stories

As a customer
I want money on my card

In order to keep using public transport

In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need my fare deducted from my card

In order to get through the barriers
As a customer
I need to touch in and out

In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need to have the minimum amount for a single journey

In order to know where I have been
As a customer

In order to know how far I have travelled
